# Overview of the Project
## Project: CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION AND ANALYSIS on Online Retail Sales Dataset
## Objective
1. Perform customer segmentation analysis on a retail dataset (online_retail_sales_dataset.csv) to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior.
2. Use clustering techniques like K-means to group customers and analyze segment characteristics.
## Key Activities
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Create New Variables
- Perform Customer Segmentation using Clustering Techniques
    -Standardize the Data: It's important to standardize the features before clustering, especially when the features have different scales.
    -K-Means Clustering: Apply the K-means algorithm and experiment with different numbers of clusters. Use the Elbow method or Silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Cluster Analysis
- Data Visualization
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter notebook
- Power BI
- Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn
- KMeans, silhouette_score, StandardScaler
- .csv file
## Key Insights and Interpretation
-Analyze each cluster:
  Dive into the clusters identified by K-means or DBSCAN.
  For each cluster, summarize the key characteristics of customers.
  Determine what percentage of the total customer base each cluster represents.

-Visualize the Clusters:
  Use plots like scatter plots, bar charts, or heatmaps to visualize the clusters and their characteristics.

-Plot Analysis: 
  When you plot the Silhouette scores, you should look for the peak point, where the score is highest. This peak indicates the most optimal clustering configuration.

-Optimal Clusters: 
  The code will print the optimal number of clusters based on the maximum Silhouette score.
